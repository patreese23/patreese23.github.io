            <h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
            <p>Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) causes a slight but noticeable decline in mental abilities, such as memory loss and impaired thinking. People with MCI have a much higher risk of going on to develop dementia.</p>   
<p>Previous research has shown that regular exercise may help improve brain health and prevent dementia. This study is comparing the effectiveness of three different kinds of exercise on memory and thinking abilities.</p>

<p> This study seeks men and women aged 60+ who have noticed a slight decline in their memory and/or other mental abilities. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three different exercise training groups: a) Strength training group, b) Aerobic training group, or c) Balance, toning & mobility training group.  Participants will be invited to attend 3 supervised exercise sessions per week for 12 months at the research site in Lidcombe.</p>
